# {{pkg.name}}

{{pkg.description}}

## Installation

Drag this link to your browser's bookmarks bar: <a href="javascript:void {{code}}">{{pkg.name}}</a>

## Usage

1. Open a (finished) game or a game review on [OGS](https://online-go.com/).
2. Click the bookmark you made during the Installation step.
3. A bar chart will appear below the goban. It displays the time taken for the current move as you navigate forwards and backwards through the game's moves. Hovering over the chart also does something.
4. There is a "Hide" button above the chart. Click that when done.
